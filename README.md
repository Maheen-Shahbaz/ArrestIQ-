🌍 ArrestIQ – Categorical Analysis using Python

🧾 Project Overview

This project explores arrest data through the lens of data science and statistical analysis. Using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, it uncovers meaningful insights from demographic and behavioral attributes within the dataset.

The goal is to identify trends, correlations, and categorical distributions related to arrests, allowing for a better understanding of the underlying social and behavioral patterns.


📊 What’s in This Project

Data Cleaning & Preparation: Handling missing data, formatting inconsistencies, and feature refinement.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Generating visual insights such as age, gender, and offense distribution.

Categorical Analysis: Breaking down arrest data by multiple categorical variables.

Visualization Dashboard: Graphs, charts, and comparative plots created using Seaborn & Matplotlib.

Statistical Summary: Descriptive statistics highlighting mean, median, mode, and variable correlations.
